Goal

For this resit assignment, your goal is to build an interactive online store using the provided API endpoints. You are required to dynamically retrieve product data and implement features that demonstrate your proficiency in JavaScript and modern web development practices.

You may use your existing cross course project code as a starting point or start a
fresh project if this is not available. We recommend using an existing project as
styling will not be graded but is nice to have in the final submission.

Resources

You have been provided with the following API to use:

    GameHub API- Video games

The documentation website for the API explains which options are available on the provided objects. These properties should be used and displayed to the user in your application.


Important Features

This list is a non-exhaustive list of important things to keep in mind before delivery:

    Errors should be handled for the user, such that they are alerted when something goes wrong like an API call.
    A loading indicator should be shown to the user whenever they are waiting for an asynchronous action to finish.
    There should be no hard coded product data in your final submission.
    Although the focus on marking is on JavaScript, the site still needs to be accessible and usable for the user. If we cannot access functionality that has been coded, it will be marked as if the coding was not done.
    Use `async` instead of `then` syntax for asynchronous actions.
    Remove all console.log statements before delivery.
    Ensure your code is properly formatted before delivery.


Delivery
    GitHub repository with JavaScript code in the default (main/master) branch.
    Written reflection on the CA process delivered as a PDF document.
